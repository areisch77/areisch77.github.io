        <h1><a href="https://www.louisiana.gov/">Favorite- Louisiana</a></h1>
        <p>I like this website because of its picture and color combo. I think they go good together. I can tell that the map and picture combo could have been complicated as well. I like how well the website is designed in means to the content and where it is placed. It is well arranged. </p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.tn.gov/">Tennesee</a></h2>
<p>This is my second favorite wensite. I like the nivo slider that is in the beginning of the page. I also like how the page stays the same and sorted the same when i shrink the page down. I like how they organized the pages on the top navigation, as well as the bottom. I like the news portion thats on the bottom as well. It overall is a well built site.  </p>

        <h3><a href="http://sd.gov/">South Dakota</a></h3>
        <p>Now this website isnt as complex, but it is still a decent website. I like how they have the background picture set, it really goes with the theme and how SD is pictured and thought of. They have a ok navigation at the top, but this website doesnt have as many of the bells and whistles as the last one. They have links to everything, not very interactive though.</p>
        
      <h4><a href="https://mt.gov/">Montana</a></h4>
<p>Montanas website has some good colors going. It is interactive right from the start with the nivo slider, all these websites are a little similar with some of the same topics, but just different content. It has a beautiful backgrund picture right from the start that catches youre eye. The navigation is well put together too.
    
    <h4><a href="https://www.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx#home">West Virginia</a></h4>
<p>This one is probably my least favorite. The colors dont pop and its kinda basic and plain. There is a nivo slider, but thats the only thing really on the first page that catches your eye. Navigation is basic, at the top of the home page. Just alot of links to different pages, the home page is like a navigation page.

<h1>What is Parade of Homes</h1>
<p><img src="parade.jpg" class="bgpic"> Parade of homes is something very special that Hayden Homes does once a month. Hayden finds a family in need and gives them a house. Hayden thinks that giving back to the community every chance he gets is very important. Helping a family by giving them a home for free can really get them back on their feet. Hayden wants to make the worl a better place, and help anyone any chance he gets.
